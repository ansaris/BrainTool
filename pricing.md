# BrainTool Pricing and Data Philosophy
There's been a trend for the last while to give software away for free and make money off of the data you can collect and sell. BrainTool strives to take a completely hands off approach to your data. Your data is yours, BrainTool uses it with your permission to provide you tools to manage, organize and access it. With a subscription or purchase you are paying for those tools and their continued improvement, and keeping your data to yourself.

The fully-functional free version and current low pricing are designed to encourage broad adoption. See the [vision and overview](overview) page for more details.

<p style="margin-top: -20px;"><i><small>NB Based on user feedback the previous subscription cost has been reduced and a one-time purchase option added.</small></i></p>
